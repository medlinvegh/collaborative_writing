This is the beginning.

A long time ago... There was a group of kids. One kid was named Max.

He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
They were in a brightly lit white room. There were no walls and no path to travelâ€¦ they were stuck, lost and confused. They were confused for a moment then they looked up. A bright light emerged from the sky, and a large spaceship came down. Out of the spaceship, emerged a tiny little bichon frise- what will come next for planet earth? No one knows.
